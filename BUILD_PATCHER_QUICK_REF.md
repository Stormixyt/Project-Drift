# Build Patcher Quick Reference

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Windows (PowerShell - Recommended)
```powershell
.\patch-build.ps1
```
Follow the interactive prompts!

### Node.js (Fast, scripts only)
```bash
node tools/build-patcher.js "C:\Path\To\Fortnite"
```

### Python (Advanced, with binary patching)
```bash
python tools/build-patcher.py "C:\Path\To\Fortnite"
```

## 📋 What the ERA Build Taught Us

The working 7.20 build uses these techniques:

### 1. Launch Arguments (Most Important!)
```bat
FortniteLauncher.exe ^
  -epicapp=Fortnite ^
  -epicenv=Prod ^
  -epicportal ^
  -epiclocale=en-us ^
  -skippatchcheck ^
  -HTTP=WinInet ^
  -NOSSLPINNING
```

**Key flags:**
- `-NOSSLPINNING` → Disables SSL certificate pinning (CRITICAL)
- `-skippatchcheck` → Skips Epic's version verification
- `-HTTP=WinInet` → Uses Windows HTTP (easier to intercept with hosts file)

### 2. Hosts File Redirection
All Epic domains point to `127.0.0.1`:
```
127.0.0.1 account-public-service-prod.ol.epicgames.com
127.0.0.1 fortnite-public-service-prod.ol.epicgames.com
127.0.0.1 lightswitch-public-service-prod.ol.epicgames.com
```

### 3. MCP Backend
- Runs on port 3551
- Accepts any username/password
- Returns proper Epic API responses

### 4. Optional DLL Injection
For extra bypasses:
- Epic Launcher process check
- Anti-cheat hooks
- Debug detection

## 🔧 Patcher Tools Comparison

| Feature | Node.js | Python | PowerShell |
|---------|---------|--------|------------|
| Speed | ⚡ Fast | 🐌 Slower | 📝 Wrapper |
| Binary Patching | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Delegates |
| Script Creation | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Delegates |
| Cross-platform | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ Windows |
| User-friendly | 🤷 CLI | 🤷 CLI | ✅ Interactive |

**Recommendation:** Use PowerShell wrapper for best experience!

## 📁 Output Files

After patching, you'll find in `FortniteGame\Binaries\Win64\`:

```
Launcher.bat              ← Basic launcher with bypass args
Quick-Start.bat           ← One-click launch (recommended!)
Inject-Bypass.bat         ← DLL injection (if built)
PROJECT_DRIFT_README.txt  ← Usage instructions
FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping.exe.backup  ← Original (if binary patched)
```

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Patch a downloaded build
```powershell
# Interactive
.\patch-build.ps1

# Or directly
.\patch-build.ps1 -BuildPath "D:\Fortnite\7.20"
```

### Test before patching (dry run)
```bash
python tools/build-patcher.py "C:\Fortnite\7.40" --dry-run
```

### Skip binary patching (safer)
```bash
python tools/build-patcher.py "C:\Fortnite\7.40" --no-binary-patch
```

### Integrate with build importer
```javascript
// In your build import script
import BuildPatcher from './tools/build-patcher.js';

const patcher = new BuildPatcher(buildPath, projectRoot);
await patcher.patchBuild();
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### ❌ "Missing required file: FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping.exe"
**Problem:** Invalid build path or incomplete build

**Fix:**
- Make sure you're pointing to the ROOT folder (not Binaries/Win64)
- Verify the build has `FortniteGame\Binaries\Win64\FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping.exe`

### ❌ "Pattern not found" (Python patcher)
**Problem:** Different Fortnite version with different code

**Fix:**
- This is OK! Use `--no-binary-patch` flag
- The launch arguments are usually enough

### ❌ Game crashes after patching
**Problem:** Binary patch was incompatible or anti-cheat interference

**Fix:**
1. Restore backup: `FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping.exe.backup` → `FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping.exe`
2. Re-patch with `--no-binary-patch`
3. Disable anti-cheat by renaming `BattlEye` and `EasyAntiCheat` folders

### ⚠️ "Can't connect to Fortnite servers"
**Problem:** MCP backend not running or hosts file not configured

**Fix:**
```bash
# 1. Start MCP backend
cd mcp-backend
npm run dev

# 2. Verify it's running
netstat -an | findstr 3551

# 3. Check hosts file (requires admin)
notepad C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
# Should have Epic domains → 127.0.0.1

# 4. Run as admin if needed
```

## 🔬 Understanding Binary Patches

### SSL Pinning Bypass
**Before:**
```asm
test al, al      ; Check if cert valid
jz   fail        ; Jump if invalid
```

**After:**
```asm
test al, al      ; Check (preserved)
nop              ; No operation
jmp  success     ; Always succeed
```

### Why it works:
- Fortnite checks SSL certificates against Epic's CA
- Patching makes it accept any certificate
- Combined with `-NOSSLPINNING` flag for double security

### Note:
Most modern builds work WITHOUT binary patching thanks to the `-NOSSLPINNING` flag!

## 🎮 After Patching

### Launch the Game
```bash
# Option 1: Quick start (recommended)
cd <build>\FortniteGame\Binaries\Win64
.\Quick-Start.bat

# Option 2: Manual
# Terminal 1: Start MCP
cd mcp-backend && npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Launch game
cd <build>\FortniteGame\Binaries\Win64
.\Launcher.bat
```

### Login
- Username: **anything** (e.g., "player1")
- Password: **anything** (e.g., "password")
- MCP backend accepts all credentials

### Expected Flow
1. ✅ Game launches
2. ✅ Login screen appears
3. ✅ Enter any credentials
4. ✅ MCP backend authenticates you
5. ✅ You're in the lobby!

## 🔄 Re-patching

If you need to patch the same build again:

```bash
# The patcher is idempotent - safe to run multiple times
.\patch-build.ps1 -BuildPath "C:\Fortnite\7.20"

# Binary patches create backups, so you can always restore
```
