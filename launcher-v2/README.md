4. Launch Project Drift from your desktop or start menu

### Option 2: Build from Source

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 20+ installed
- npm or yarn package manager

**Steps:**

```powershell
# Navigate to launcher directory
cd launcher

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode

```

The built installer will be in `launcher/dist/Project Drift Setup 1.0.0.exe`

## Development

### Running in Dev Mode

```powershell
cd launcher
npm install
npm run dev
```

This opens the launcher with DevTools enabled.

### Configuration

The launcher connects to the matchmaking API at `http://localhost:8080` by default.

To change this, set the `API_URL` environment variable:

```powershell
$env:API_URL="https://your-api-server.com/api"
npm start
```

4. The game will connect to an available server automatically

### Importing a Build

- Try running as Administrator

### Game Won't Launch

## API Integration

The launcher communicates with the Project Drift backend:

- **Authentication**: `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`
- **Builds**: `/api/builds` (list), `/api/builds/:id/download`
- **Stats**: `/api/users/:id/stats`
- **Friends**: `/api/users/:id/friends`
- **Servers**: `/api/servers` (find available game servers)

## Building an Installer

To create a Windows installer:

```powershell
npm run build:win
```

This uses `electron-builder` and creates:
- Portable .exe
- NSIS installer with uninstaller
- Auto-updater support (if configured)

## Tech Stack

- **Electron** - Desktop application framework
- **Node.js** - Backend runtime
- **Vanilla JS** - No frameworks, lightweight and fast
- **CSS3** - Modern styling with animations
