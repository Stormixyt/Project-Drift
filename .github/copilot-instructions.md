# Project Drift - Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
Project Drift is a multiplayer game platform that enables players to host and join custom game builds. It features:
- Unity C# client (Windows .exe)
- Rust authoritative game server
- Node.js matchmaking service
- React admin dashboard
- Full networking stack (UDP, WebRTC, STUN/TURN)

## Tech Stack
- **Client**: Unity 2022.3 LTS, C#, IL2CPP backend
- **Server**: Rust (tokio, quinn for QUIC/UDP)
- **Matchmaking**: Node.js 20+, Express, Socket.io, Redis, PostgreSQL
- **Admin UI**: React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Inter font
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, coturn, PostgreSQL, Redis

## Code Style & Standards
- Use production-level error handling and logging
- Follow clean architecture principles
- Maintain separation of concerns between layers
- Write deterministic, testable code
- Use async/await patterns consistently
- Keep UI minimalist: black/gray base with neon blue (#00D9FF) accents

## Security Requirements
- All APIs must use TLS
- JWT (HS256) tokens for authentication
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- Anti-cheat: velocity/teleport detection
- Sandbox imported builds to prevent system crashes

## Development Workflow
1. Local development uses Docker Compose
2. All services must be independently testable
3. Follow the roadmap in README.md
4. Write tests for critical systems (determinism, networking, load)
5. Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Design Guidelines
- Minimalist, flat UI design
- Glass morphism effects where appropriate
- Inter font for web, default Unity fonts for game
- Consistent spacing and grid layouts
- Responsive design for admin dashboard

## File Organization
- `/client/unity/` - Unity game client
- `/server/` - Rust game server
- `/matchmaking/` - Node.js service
- `/admin/` - React dashboard
- `/docs/` - Documentation
- `/tests/` - Test suites
- `/ci/` - CI/CD configurations
- `/docker/` - Container configs

## Networking Architecture
- Client → Server: UDP (QUIC) for game state
- Client → Matchmaking: WebSocket + REST
- NAT traversal via STUN/TURN (coturn)
- 30-60Hz server tick rate
- Client-side prediction with server reconciliation
