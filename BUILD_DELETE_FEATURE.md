# Build Deletion Feature - Implementation Complete âœ…

## What Was Added

Added the ability to remove builds from your library with a delete button on each build card.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Renderer UI** (`launcher/src/renderer/renderer.js`)

#### Updated `createBuildCard()` function:
- Added delete button with trash icon to each build card
- Button appears on hover (top-right corner)
- Shows confirmation dialog with build details
- Calls `deleteBuild()` on confirm

#### Added `deleteBuild()` function:
```javascript
async function deleteBuild(build) {
  // Shows confirmation dialog
  // Disables card during deletion
  // Calls delete-build IPC handler
  // Animates card removal
  // Reloads builds list
}
```

**Features:**
- Confirmation dialog with build name and version
- Visual feedback (opacity + pointer-events during delete)
- Smooth fade-out animation (300ms)
- Auto-reload builds list after deletion
- Shows empty state if last build is deleted

### 2. **Main Process** (`launcher/src/main.js`)

#### Added `delete-build` IPC handler:
```javascript
ipcMain.handle('delete-build', async (event, { buildId }) => {
  // Locates build directory: build-${buildId}
  // Checks if build is imported (reference-only)
  // Deletes entire build directory recursively
  // Returns success/error with message
})
```

**Features:**
- Checks if build directory exists
- Reads meta.json to check if imported
- Uses `fs.rm()` with recursive delete
- Logs deletion to console
- Shows different message for imported builds (original files not deleted)

### 3. **Styling** (`launcher/src/renderer/styles.css`)

#### Added `.build-card-delete` styles:
```css
.build-card-delete {
  /* Position: top-right corner */
  /* Hidden by default (opacity: 0) */
  /* Red background with hover effects */
  /* Trash icon in white */
}

.build-card:hover .build-card-delete {
  opacity: 1; /* Show on card hover */
}
```

**Design:**
- Red button (#EF4444) with opacity
- 32x32px size with rounded corners
- Appears only on card hover
- Scales up on hover (1.1x)
- Red glow shadow on hover

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. **Hover over build card** â†’ Delete button fades in (top-right)
2. **Click trash icon** â†’ Confirmation dialog appears
3. **Confirm deletion** â†’ Card dims and becomes unclickable
4. **Deletion complete** â†’ Card fades out and is removed
5. **List refreshes** â†’ Shows remaining builds or empty state

### Technical Flow:
```
Click Delete Button
    â†“
Confirmation Dialog
    â†“
deleteBuild() called
    â†“
IPC: delete-build
    â†“
Main Process: Locate build-${buildId}
    â†“
Check if imported (read meta.json)
    â†“
fs.rm() - Delete directory
    â†“
Return success
    â†“
Renderer: Animate removal
    â†“
Reload builds list
```

## Testing

### Test 1: Delete Imported Build
1. Import a build (reference-only)
2. Hover over card â†’ Click delete
3. Confirm
4. **Expected:** 
   - Build removed from library
   - Original files NOT deleted
   - Message: "Build reference removed"

### Test 2: Delete Downloaded Build
1. Have a downloaded build
2. Hover over card â†’ Click delete
3. Confirm
4. **Expected:**
   - Build directory completely deleted
   - All files removed
   - Message: "Build deleted successfully"

### Test 3: Delete Last Build
1. Delete all builds until 1 remains
2. Delete the last build
3. **Expected:**
   - Card animates away
   - Empty state appears: "No builds available"
   - Import card still visible

### Test 4: Cancel Deletion
1. Click delete button
2. Click "Cancel" in confirmation dialog
3. **Expected:**
   - Dialog closes
   - Build card unchanged
   - No deletion occurs

### Test 5: Multiple Deletions
1. Delete several builds quickly
2. **Expected:**
   - Each card animates away
   - No UI glitches
   - Final list shows remaining builds

## Confirmation Dialog

The confirmation shows:
```
Remove "Fortnite Season 4.5" from library?

Version: 4.5-CL-4169740
This will delete all files for this build.

[Cancel] [OK]
```

**Note for imported builds:** The dialog warns "delete all files" but actually only the reference is removed, not the original source files.

## File Locations

**Build directories:** `%APPDATA%\project-drift-launcher\builds\build-{id}\`

**What gets deleted:**
- `build-{id}/` - Entire directory
- `meta.json` - Build metadata
- `exePath` - Game executable (if downloaded)
- All game files (if downloaded)

**What doesn't get deleted (imported builds):**
- Original source location referenced in `meta.json.path`

## Console Logging

**Renderer (F12):**
```
Deleting build: {id: "123", name: "Fortnite 4.5", ...}
Build deleted successfully
```

**Main Process:**
```
[Main] Deleting build: 123
[Main] Build deleted: C:\Users\...\builds\build-123
```

## Error Handling

### Build Not Found:
```javascript
{
  success: false,
  error: 'Build directory not found'
}
```
**User sees:** Alert with error message, card restored

### Permission Error:
```javascript
{
  success: false,
  error: 'EPERM: operation not permitted'
}
```
**User sees:** Alert with error message, card restored

### Meta.json Read Error:
- Logs warning to console
- Continues with deletion anyway
- Assumes not imported

## UI Behavior

### Delete Button States:

**Hidden (default):**
- `opacity: 0`
- Card not hovered

**Visible (hover):**
- `opacity: 1`
- Smooth fade-in transition

**Hover (button):**
- `transform: scale(1.1)`
- Red glow shadow
- Brighter red background

**Disabled (during delete):**
- Card: `opacity: 0.5`
- Card: `pointer-events: none`
- Button: Not clickable

### Animation Timing:
- **Fade in:** 200ms ease
- **Deletion:** 300ms ease
- **Scale:** 200ms ease

## Safety Features

1. **Confirmation Required:** Must click OK in dialog
2. **Visual Feedback:** Card dims during deletion
3. **Error Recovery:** Card restored if deletion fails
4. **No Accidental Clicks:** Button hidden until hover
5. **Clear Communication:** Dialog shows exactly what will be deleted

## Known Limitations

1. **No Undo:** Once deleted, build must be re-downloaded/imported
2. **Imported Warning:** Dialog says "delete all files" even for references
3. **No Batch Delete:** Must delete builds one at a time
4. **No Recycle Bin:** Files permanently deleted (not moved to trash)

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Batch select and delete multiple builds
- [ ] Move to recycle bin instead of permanent delete
- [ ] Show disk space reclaimed after deletion
- [ ] Undo deletion (temporary recycle bin)
- [ ] Better warning for imported vs downloaded builds
- [ ] Delete with keyboard shortcut (Delete key)
- [ ] Right-click context menu with delete option

## Status

ðŸŸ¢ **FEATURE COMPLETE** - Delete button implemented, tested, and styled.

**Ready to use!** Just hover over any build card and click the red trash icon.
