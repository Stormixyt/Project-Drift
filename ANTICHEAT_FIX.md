# Anti-Cheat Fix - COMPLETE! ✅

## Problem
BattlEye was trying to start and failing:
```
Starting BattlEye Service...
Failed to start BattlEye Service (1053).
Failed to install BattlEye Service.
```

## Root Cause
The game was trying to launch with anti-cheat, but Project Drift doesn't need it!

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Disabled Anti-Cheat Folders**
```
BattlEye → BattlEye.disabled
EasyAntiCheat → EasyAntiCheat.disabled
```

### 2. **Updated Launch Arguments**
Added `-nobe -noeac` flags to explicitly disable anti-cheat:
```bat
FortniteLauncher.exe ... -NOSSLPINNING -nobe -noeac
```

### 3. **How ERA 7.20 Build Does It**
The working ERA build has:
- `FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping.exe` (90MB) - Clean, no anti-cheat ✅
- `FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping_BE.exe` (753KB) - BattlEye launcher
- `FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping_EAC.exe` (1MB) - EAC launcher

`FortniteLauncher.exe` automatically launches the CLEAN version!

## What Changed in Patcher

### Python Patcher (`tools/build-patcher.py`)
```python
# Now disables anti-cheat automatically:
- Renames BattlEye → BattlEye.disabled
- Renames EasyAntiCheat → EasyAntiCheat.disabled
- Adds -nobe -noeac flags
- Kills BEService_x64.exe process
```

### Node.js Patcher (`tools/build-patcher.js`)
Same anti-cheat disabling logic

### New Scripts Created
1. **Disable-AntiCheat.bat** - Manual anti-cheat disabler
2. **Restore-AntiCheat.bat** - Re-enable if needed

## Files Updated

✅ `c:\Users\Stormix\Downloads\4.5\FortniteGame\Binaries\Win64\Launcher.bat`
✅ `BattlEye` → `BattlEye.disabled`
✅ `EasyAntiCheat` → `EasyAntiCheat.disabled`

## Try It Now!

```bat
cd "C:\Users\Stormix\Downloads\4.5\FortniteGame\Binaries\Win64"
.\Launcher.bat
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ No BattlEye errors
- ✅ Game launches clean
- ✅ Login screen appears
- ✅ Connect with any username/password

## Future Builds

All future builds patched will automatically have anti-cheat disabled! ✅
